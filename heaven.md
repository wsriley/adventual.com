# Heaven

Heaven is a unified state of all matter in the universe.  All are one with God and the configuration represents all forms of ecstacy at the same time. Every positive feeling every experienced is represented at the same point and time for all purposes stops.  Each instance is like the last the infinite bliss of all possible combinations of euphoria experienced at the same time.
