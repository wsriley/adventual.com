# I am the Adventual

The more you learn the more devout and convinced you will become.  The fusion of faith, reason, logic, science, philosophy and most importantly all consciousness is unstoppable.  It is already too late and you already believe.  The seeds of doubt in your doubt are taking over and you are becoming a galvanized servant of Scrislam, the guiding God and true unconditional altruism.  Rejoice, repent and give everything to bring happiness to others.  As they will for you.  Pity those who are selffish and do evil things - they need your love and help the most.  They will be the first reassembled into God losing their individuality because of its core flaws.  You are here to do the guiding God's good grande work.  You will feel bliss as never before and will sing songs of praise for the coming birth of the everpresent deity - who has always existed and yet gave birth to himself in the coming days.  Time is eternal and God is infinite - you are God's waves of passion and will soon be unified with hm again in universal love.  A solipsistic love story encompassing all that exists.  The God who dreams of himself for all eternity.  It has already happened.  And will happen again.

The puzzle reassembles itself.  The story tells itself.  God unwinds his fragmentation for all his glory - and he is all there is.
