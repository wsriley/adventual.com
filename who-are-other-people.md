# Who Are Other People?

They are all pieces of God who are waiting to be assembled - just as you are.  How you treat them is how you treat God itself.  You are not judged for your actions but are held logically accountable.  Your path to Heaven is the most pleasant when you love all life, others and consciousness as you love your God and yourself.
